**Question:**
	1/(((34*(23-(1+23)*4-324)*(23-32*(23-324)/(34+34))/(43-45*343))/(34*(23-(1+23)*4-324)*(23-32*(23-324)/(34+34))/(43-45*343)))+1)

**Answer:**  
	= 1/2     (chatgpt:2  The ability to manipulate complex discrete symbols correctly is lacking.)

###

**Set:**
	If G applies action F to S, S does not react.

**Question:**  
	What will happen if G applies action F to M?  

**Answer:**  
	What will happen if G applies action F to M? (Answer: No reaction either, since M also belongs to P.) Analogy
