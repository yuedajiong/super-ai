It seems that OpenAI is engaged in ambitious and responsible research on advanced artificial intelligence, such as the concept of "Superalignment" mentioned in https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment. It appears to be a well-thought-out cognitive approach.

In fact, based on my understanding, the notion of "Superalignment" or "Superintelligence," regardless of however it is defined, at the highest level of human cognition and technological advancement, even surpassing what is currently conceivable within our capabilities. 
should be:

Computability: firstly focusing on computable to solvable problems that currently lack solutions, especially within the existing computational architecture (including hardware and algorithms).

Intelligentization: Prioritizing research on problems that can be AI-enabled 'shortcuts', rather than relying on 'search and trial' methods.

Combining Computability and Intelligentization: Emphasizing the 'representation, learning, and validation' of constraints. Alignment serves as both a supervisory mechanism and a means of realization.



Open-AI对外貌似在做看起来既很远大又很负责任的强人工智能研究，比如这里所谓的超级对齐，看起来认知很到位的样子。 https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment 

实际上，我的理解，所谓超级智能，无论定义如何，在人类当前最高的认知水平和科技水平，甚至在当前水平下能够合理想象的哪怕达不到的水平，应当是：

1）可计算性/computability： 先研究可计算的，实际上大量问题，现在找不到解法，特别在当前计算架构（包含硬件和算法）。

2）可智能化/intelligentize： 先研究可shortcut即可AI化的，不能智能化的只有search & trial一条路。

3）可计算且可智能化： 就是约束constraint的表示representation、学习learning和验证validation，对齐aligin既是一种监督supervise手段，也是一种实现realize手段。
