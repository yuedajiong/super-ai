OpenAI Sora is good but not enough, we still need GS/SuGaR/4D-Mesh/... !

OpenAI Sora has caused quite a sensation, really very good, but I Firmly Believe that achieving physically correct interactions for Foreground Objects in the Stereo Motion World still requires the strict implementation of Stereo Surface and Motion Constraints, as provided by GS/SuGraR/4D-Mesh/..., to eliminate Visual Hallucination in video.

With OpenAI's talent and computing power, if there is also a large-scale investment in stereo reconstruction/generation, and if a better 4D-GS representation is designed, a significant advancement in results is likely.

Wherever OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta AI go, not a blade of grass grows. Pity for small and medium-sized startups, small research teams, and even independent researchers.

Similar to Mathink, combining DL+RL for predictive planning and Lean4 for rigorous formal verification is necessary to provide rigorous reasoning.

SO:
DRL/gen-planning+reasoning + Lean4.../run
DRL/gen-4dworld + UE5(even Robot).../run
