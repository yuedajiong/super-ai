# Me, Super-AI
  Independent-Researcher
  
  Never work for any country, any orgnization, any company, any individual.
  
  Never be used for 'Beijing China'.

  Just for my dream: approach to the demiurge, through super-intelligence. 
  
# 2023-07-01

  I have resigned from my last company, financial independence, and full-time for super-ai researching and implementation.
  
  I will record my key insights in the process of researching and implementation to super intelligence in Chinese.
  (If you need to read, please translate them into your own language.)

# 2024-03-15 (dynamaic-stereo-vision-direction)

  The first version of the ultimate visual model is completed.
  
  input: single-image, camera-free/train&infer, mask-support, incremental-hash-priori (so-far: single-object)
  
  output: explicit-stereo-representation (only: stereo; todo: dynamic and interactive.)

# 2024-11-21 / 2024-12-14 (<brain-like> ultimate-learning-and-thinking-direction)

  With accompanying features: incremental/online learning.
  
  2024-11-21: The 1st version of the non-BP learning (block-independent-leaning, w/ or w/o target). Effitive! Tested on: MLP, dimension-reduction, classification.
  
  2024-12-14: The 2nd version of the non-BP learning (block-independent-leaning, w/ or w/o target). Effitive! Tested on: MLP, regression (difficult-task-type, a little different with classification), generation should be easy. Not implement on larget attention/transformer network and  cifar10/100 or other big dataset task.
  
# 2029-09-22 (ASI)
  2025-03-01 to 2025-08-31: In the summer of 2025, collaborated with Justin(https://github.com/yuenuting) to develop the Neural Octree Mesh representation algorithm, addressing highly detailed very large scale 3D representations and enabling neural network learnable.   
  
  2025-09-01 to 2025-09-21: Completed the first version of the ASI program, capable of confidently handling tasks such as ARC-AGI, Math Solver Tasks (SAT/IP/MIP/...), Sudoku, and more.
  
  Conclusion: There is NO such thing as so-called AGI/ASI - what truly matters is diligent, systematic task-solving. However, problems can be abstracted into common solution frameworks; yet, both learning and searching remain indispensable. The common components include:
  
    Problem representation
    
    Transformation of problem solution space (compression/abstraction, decomposition)
    
    General representation of solutions (one-shot function) and structured representation (directed graph)
    
    Automatic construction of atomic solution functions
    
    Brute-force search based on atomic solution functions, and
    
    Heuristic search guided by prior learning as state-action mappings (generalized reasoning: DG{A|S}, ...)

# long-term: (super-ai) 
(not generative direction; Fig.2 strcuture/algorithm is still on developing ...)
